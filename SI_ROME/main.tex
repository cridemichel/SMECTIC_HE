\section{Smectic phase characterization}

\subsection{Static Structure factor}

A way to characterize the smectic phase obtained from the simulations is provided by the calculation of the structure factor \cite{Hansen_McDonald}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:S_q}
    S( \vec{q} ) = \left\langle \frac{1}{N} \rho_{\vec{q}} \rho_{-\vec{q}} \right\rangle 
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of scattering points and $\rho_{\vec{q}}$ is the Fourier transform of the microscopic density:

\begin{equation}
    \rho_{\vec{q}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \exp(-i\, \vec{q} \cdot \vec{r}_i)
\end{equation}

In order to compute the average in equation \ref{eq:S_q}, a Monte Carlo simulation in the NVT ensemble has been performed starting by a configuration in the smectic phase $(\phi = 0.50)$. Each particle of the system is substituted by a random mesh of scattering points proportional to its volume, as represented in Fig. \ref{fig:scatt_mod_single} and Fig. \ref{fig:scatt_mod1}. Given the in-plane 2D isotropy of the smectic phase, it has been calculated the structure factor relative to a plane parallel to the magnetic field $y$, namely $S(0, q_y, q_z)$. The results of these analyses are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Syz_B_HE} for ellipsoids and in Fig. \ref{fig:Syz_B_HSC} for spherocylinders.

    \label{fig:Syz_B_HSC}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Pair distribution function}

The spatial characterization of the phases can be further analyzed by  the calculation of the three-dimensional pair distribution function $g(\vec{r})$:

\begin{equation}
    g(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{\rho N} \left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j\neq i} \delta \left( \vec{r} - \left( \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j \right) \right) \right\rangle
\end{equation}

where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function. This quantity has been calculated averaging on the same configurations used for the structure factor \ref{eq:S_q}, obtaining the pair distribution function on a plane parallel to the magnetic field $yz$ and on the perpendicular plane $xz$. The results are represented in Fig. \ref{fig:gyz_B} and Fig. \ref{fig:gxz_B}. The smectic phase is evident: it can be noticed the different planes along the y axis (Fig. \ref{fig:gyz_B}) and the 2D liquid behaviour in-plane (Fig. \ref{fig:gxz_B}).
Differently the radial distribution function of HEs does not show any layering for all state points studies.
A typical example of $g(r)$ for HEs is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:gyz_B_HE} (yz-plane) and Fig.~\ref{fig:gxz_B_HE} (xz-plane). The anisotropy and structuring shown in Fig.\ref{fig:gyz_B_HE} reflect the alignment of HEs due
to the magnetic field. Differently, the anisotropy of the radial distribution function calculated
onto a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gxz_B_HE}, is due to 
orientational ordering of HEs, which builds up at volume fraction higher than $\approx 0.45$. 
More details on this are provided below (see Section ``Smectic and nematic ordering'').

\section{Absence of magnetic field}

In order to demonstrate the magnetic origin of the smectic phase in these systems, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation in the NVT ensemble of a smectic configuration of spherocylinders with $\phi = 0.50$. As represented in Fig. \ref{fig:noB_snapshot}, in absence of a magnetic field the system preferentially arranges in a isotropic phase.

\subsection{Structure factor}
To further confirm the isotropy of this phase, it has been calculated the structure factor $S(0, q_y, q_z)$ of the system which presents a typical isotropic pattern (Fig. \ref{fig:Syz_noB}).

\subsection{Pair distribution function}

Likewise the case with a magnetic field, it has been calculated the pair distribution function of a system of spherocylinders in absence of magnetic field. As it can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:gxz_noB} and Fig. \ref{fig:gyz_noB}, the phase is clearly isotropic, without long range spatial correlation between the particles, corroborating the magnetic field induced nature of the smectic phase.

\section{Smectic and nematic ordering}

A convenient way to check for the emergence of a smectic phase in our computer simulations 
is to calculate the smectic order parameter $\tau_1$ defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \tau_1 = \langle | \sum_i e^{i 2\pi \vec{r}_i \cdot \hat{n} / d } |\rangle 
\end{equation}

where $\langle\ldots\rangle$ is an average over several independent configurations, $\vec{r}_i$ is the position of the $i$-th particle, $\hat{n}$ is the direction of the magnetic
field and $d$ is the thickness of the smectic layers.
In order to compute $\tau_1$ for each configuration we find the optimal value of $d$, i.e. 
the value which maximizes $\tau_1$.

The values of $\tau_1$ for both HSCs and HEs and for all pressures studied is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ordpars}(top). It can be seen that HSCs exhibit a range of volume fractions where 
a smectic layer ordering is present and which coincide with the green state points shown in Fig. 7(a)
in the main test. On the contrary no evidence of layering emerges in the simulation of HEs.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{smordpar.png}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{nemop.png}  
    \caption{Smectic ($\tau_1$, top) and nematic ($S$, bottom) order parameters for HSCs and HEs.}
    \label{fig:ordpars}
\end{figure}

We also calculated the nematic order parameter $S$ related to the symmetry axis of HSC and HE, which
is defined as the largest eigenvalue of the order tensor $Q$, whose components are:
\begin{equation}
Q_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \frac{3}{2} \langle (\mathbf{u}_i)_\alpha (\mathbf{u}_i)_\beta\rangle
\label{eq:nemop}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha\beta\in\{x,y,z\}$ and the unit vector $(\mathbf{u}_i)_\alpha$ is the component $\alpha$ of the orientation (i.e. the symmetry axis) of particle $i$.
First we note that since particles are aligned perpendicularly to the nematic field, if they are 
randomly oriented one has $S=1/4$. Hence, below $\phi_0 < 0.45$ both symmetry axis of HSC and HE are 
randomly oriented onto the plance perpendicular to the magnetic field.
Interestingly, for $\phi > \phi_0$ HSC starts exhibiting smectic layering but their orientations
remain random, while orientations of HE starts aligning (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ordpars}(bottom)).

\section{Shape analysis}

The particular behaviour of the particles can be understood by analysing their shape. In particular, it has been obtained the particle borders from a pool of samples belonging to the two aspect ratios ($\rho_1 = 2.82, \rho_2 = 3.69$). By developing a C++ program, the coordinates of the borders have been analysed and fitted using an ellipse and a spherocylinder. Due to the anisotropy of the particles, the analisys has been performed on the left and the right side of the particles independently (Fig. \ref{fig:Part_fit}). The fit minimizes the distance $d$ between the border coordinates of a particle and the nearest point of the fitting shape. The hybrid nature of the particles is easy to notice, particularly using a spherocylindrical fit which is very sensible to the flatness of the particle sides. The results of this analysis are represented in the histograms in Fig. \ref{fig:Mean_dist}. As it can be easily noticed, the analysis on the more elongated particles ($\rho = 3.69$) shows their almost ellipsoidal nature, leading to a lower mean distance. On the contrary, the particles with $\rho = 2.82$ present a more hybrid nature, with a comparable mean distance distribution between the two fits.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Part fit.png}
    \caption{Particle shape analysis. The border of the particles with $\rho = 3.69$ (a) and $\rho = 2.82$ (b) has been fitted using an ellipse and a spherocylinder.}
    \label{fig:Part_fit}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Mean_dist.png}
    \caption{Probability density of the minimum mean distance $d$ between the border of the particles ($\rho = 3.69$ (a) and $\rho = 2.82$ (b)) and the fitting shape.}
    \label{fig:Mean_dist}
\end{figure}

In order to analyse further the shape of the particles, the border of the two pools have been averaged and fitted as before, leading to Fig. \ref{fig:Mean_bord}a. In Fig. \ref{fig:Mean_bord}b, where is represented the mean squared distance $d^2$ of the fit as a function of the normalised position in respect to the centre of the particle. As it can be noticed, the ellispoidal fit raises its $d^2$ moving from $\rho=3.69$ to $\rho=2.82$ while the spherocylindrical one becomes lower, remarking again the hybrid nature of the particles with $\rho=2.82$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Mean_bord.png}
    \caption{(a) Average border of the particles with the two $\rho$ (black dots). Superposed are represented the two different fits that have been performed (ellipse in blue and spherocylinder in red). (b) Mean squared distance of the border from the fits as a function of the normalised distance from the centre, which corresponds to the $0$ of the vertical axis.}
    \label{fig:Mean_bord}
\end{figure}

Thus, the particles can't be described as ellipse neither spherocylinders, instead as a intermediate shape. Hence, to demonstrate the different behaviour of these two types of particles it has been calculated the flatness of the particles as follows. Starting from the middle section of the particles, it has been performed a linear fit of the border, calculating the mean distance $d$ of the border from the fitting line. Then, adding more fitting points, we calculated the maximum distance from the centre of the particle which presented a mean distance $d$ less than a threshold, i. e. $d < 1$. The result of this analysis, represented int Fig. \ref{fig:maxlength_div}, shows that the particles with $\rho=2.82$ presents a much longer flat portion in respect to those with $\rho=3.69$. This flatness can be the reason why the particles with $\rho=2.82$, even though not being perfect spherocylinders, resembles more their behaviour, while keeping the N transition typical of ellipsoids.
